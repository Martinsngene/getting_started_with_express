# Getting Started With Express js

![Typescript Banner](/assets/express.png)

Express js is still one of the most preferred Node js frameworks in the javascript ecosysytem with an average of 28 million weekly downloads. In this project, I have used some of the fundamental concepts of express js to build a todo list app. You will learn the basics and some advanced concepts in express js.

Feel free to reach out to me to contribute to this repository or for any suggestions.

## Installations

You can get express from the npm js registry using npm, yarn or pnpm. Before installing, be sure to have Node js installed. For this project, I will be using npm:

`npm install express`
